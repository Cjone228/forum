This project is a fully functional forum website designed to facilitate discussions within an academic environment. Built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Django framework, the website allows users to engage in live discussions on various topics. The live comment feature ensures that posts and replies are updated in real-time without the need to refresh the page, providing a seamless experience for users. Additionally, an account management system is implemented, requiring users to sign up and log in before contributing to discussions, enhancing user accountability and engagement. This project showcases my ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
