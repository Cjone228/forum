This project is a fully functional forum website designed to facilitate discussions within an academic environment.

Built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Django framework, the website allows users to engage in discussions on various topics.

The comment system updates when the page is refreshed, ensuring users can see the latest posts and replies.

Additionally, an account management system is implemented, requiring users to sign up and log in before contributing to discussions, enhancing user accountability and engagement.
